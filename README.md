# bazel-exploration Repository
Repository dedicated to Bazel exploration.

## Bazelisk
First, configure [`bazelisk`](https://bazel.build/install/bazelisk) in your workstation.

## Bzlmod
By default in Bazel 7.0.0 version, the [Bazel Modules](https://bazel.build/external/module) are going to be fully enabled and we now must configure the `MODULE.bazel` file in our workspace root.
